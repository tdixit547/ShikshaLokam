## 🌟 The Problem We Solve

Government school teachers in India receive training in workshops, but implementation happens alone in the classroom. When a lesson fails or a student misbehaves, there's no mentor to call. Our project targets a **500+ teacher pilot** to bridge this **"Implementation Gap"**:
- Pedagogical innovation dying after training
- Teacher burnout and isolation
- No data on what teachers actually need

**ShikshaAssistant** bridges this gap with **Just-in-Time support** designed for the **Last-Mile**, available 24/7.
